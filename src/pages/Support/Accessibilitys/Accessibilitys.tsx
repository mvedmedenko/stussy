                            practices and is supported by a diverse team of accessibility professionals, including users of assistive technologies.
                            The platform, moreover, goes beyond minimum compliance requirements by making an assistive
                            CX technology application <br /> available to customers who have trouble typing, gesturing, moving a mouse, or reading.
                            The application is free to download <br /> and it incorporates tools such as mouse and keyboard replacements,
                            voice recognition, speech enablement, hands-<br />free/touch-free  navigation, and more.
                            We want to hear from you if you encounter any accessibility barriers on our digital properties.</p>
